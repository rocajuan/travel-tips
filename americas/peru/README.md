# Perú
A true beauty in South America, with coast, mountains and jungles to explore. Super friend people, expectacular cuisine and breathtaking landscapes. Perú has a lot to offer to all types of travellers.

The coast is known for its beach towns and deserts. The mountain region is known for Machu Picchu, Arequipa and many other towns with extensive inca culture histoy. Finally, the jungle region is an amazing adventure full of virgin areas where lots of animals can be found in their natural habitat.

Becuase of the inca culture and the Spanish conquerors, Perú has a fantastic mixture of cultures, ethnicities and cuisines that have been transformed into a very valueable travel destination for lots of people.

## General information about Perú
- As all South American countries, it is important to use common sense while travelling. Do not go to known unsafe areas at night flashes all your latest tech gadgets or phone.
- People are very friend and willing to help most of the time. It might be very benefial to try and learn a bit of Spanish just in case it is hard to find someone that speaks English.
- The weather is great but it changes depending on the region: coast, mountains and jungle.
- The food in Perú is extremely well-known around the world so do yourself a favour and try the different cuisines in the cities you plan on visit. You'll not regret it. You are welcome.
- Traffic is a mess and I consider driving in Lima an extreme sport. Drivers there are very aggressive and do not follow the 'pedestrian-right-of-way' rule you see everywhere in North America. Look before crossing the street and DO NOT exptect them to stop for you.
- Two of the most touristy neighbourhoods in Lima are: Miraflores and Barranco. I highly recommend checking them out.
