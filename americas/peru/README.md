# Peru
A true beauty in South America, with coast, mountains and jungles to explore. Super friend people, expectacular cuisine and breathtaking landscapes. Peru has a lot to offer to all types of travellers. You'll definitely enjoy it. I'm not only saying that beucase it's my country; you'll see.

The coast is known for its beach towns and deserts. The mountain region is known for Cusco, Puno, Arequipa and many other towns with extensive Inca histoy. Finally, the jungle region is an amazing adventure full of virgin areas where lots of animals can be found in their natural habitat.

Because of the Incas and the Spanish conquerors, Peru has a fantastic mixture of cultures, ethnicities and cuisines that have been transformed into a very valuable travel destination for lots of people.

## General information about Peru
- As all South American countries, it is important to use common sense while travelling. Do not go to known unsafe areas at night or flash all your latest tech gadgets or phone everywhere you go.
- People are very friendly and willing to help most of the time. It might be very beneficial to try and learn a bit of Spanish just in case it is hard to find someone that speaks English.
- The weather is great but it changes depending on the region: coast, mountains and jungle. Depending on the time of the year, prepare well for the weather. Remember, air conditioning is not very common and heating systems in homes are almost non-existent.
- The food in Peru is extremely well-known around the world so do yourself a favour and try the different cuisines in the cities you plan on visit. You'll not regret it.
- Traffic is a mess, a real mess and I consider driving in Lima an extreme sport. Drivers there are very aggressive and do not follow the 'pedestrian-right-of-way' rule you see everywhere in North America. Look before crossing the street and DO NOT expect cars to stop for you.
- Two of the most touristy neighbourhoods in Lima are: Miraflores and Barranco. I highly recommend checking them out.
