## Cayo Santa María
This was an all-inclusive visit. The resort was called Star Fish Resort and it was around 2 hours away from the airport. The resort provided an airport shuttle that transported all passengers directly to the resort without any issues.

The beaches in Cayo Santa María were incredible. Clear water, calm tide and constant sun were enjoyed daily. The food was abundant, although not so sophisticated. For people that are not picky, this food would be ok.

The resort provided options for daily tours at additional costs, included but not limited to La Habana tours, Catamarán(boat) tours, snorkling, etc.

Overall, the resort experience in Cayo Santa María was amazing. Definitely something I would consider again.
