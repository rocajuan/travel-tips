## Chichen Itz√°
This is really well-known Mayan ruin which is around 2 hours from Tulum. It is a great place to visit in a day trip manner. There are several ruins to visit and it can get really crowded and hot. It is recommended to arrive early before the tour buses get there, at around 8-9am.

There is an option to have a guided tour which provides a lot more context, explanations and historic details that make this visit 100% more enjoyable and fun. You have two options for tour guide: the official ones(paid inside the ruin) or the un-official ones that you can fine outside the entrance of the ruins. Both are excellent choices; however, the "un-official" guide can be more cost effective since they work as free-lancers.
