## Playa Del Carmen
- small beach town, great town area and night life

## Tulum
Tulum is a bohemian paradise. Full of restaurants along the beach strip, amazing beaches and a laid back atmosphere, this town is a perfect destination for a relaxing escape.

this town is very tourist friendly and super safe. While staying there you can get around riding bikes, driving or in taxis. Tulum is very prepared for tourists and provides a lot of options for accomodations as well as restaurants.

A lot of people speak English in this town, since tourism is the principal business there. There are a lot of tour options including adventure, ruins and the well known Cenotes.

The Cenotes are underground caves with a natural pool inside. These cenotes are sometimes fully or partially covered, and they provided a very entertaining way of spend a couple of hours out the city. There are hundreds of cenotes near tulum.

The highlight of this town is the beach area. This is the perfect place to unwind, relax and enjoy the ocean. It is a perfect place for anyone looking to find a chill place to spend their days with limited bars at night. The night life in Tulum is not as developed just yet. But the relaxing day activities and range of restaurants provide a solid destination for food and beach enthusiasts.

## Chichen Itzá
This is really well-known Mayan ruin which is around 2 hours from Tulum. It is a great place to visit in a day trip manner. There are several ruins to visit and it can get really crowded and hot. It is recommended to arrive early before the tour buses get there, at around 8-9am.

There is an option to have a guided tour which provides a lot more context, explanations and historic details that make this visit 100% more enjoyable and fun. You have two options for tour guide: the official ones(paid inside the ruin) or the un-official ones that you can fine outside the entrance of the ruins. Both are excellent choices; however, the "un-official" guide can be more cost effective since they work as free-lancers.

## Valladolid
Valladolid was a small colonial town around 1 hour away from Tulum. It is a perfect destination to visit while returning from the Chichen Itzá ruins since it's on the way.

This town has a small but very beautiful square and church that represents very accurately many small towns in Central and South America. The town itself is very small and a pit-stop of 1-2 hours is more than enough to get to know it, have some food and continue your way back to tulum.
