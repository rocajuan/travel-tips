## Ha Long Bay
Ha Long Bay is huge for tourists and for good reason. The Bay is one of the most incredible sceneries I have seen anywhere in the world. The bay cruise is a must-see in this location. It involves a daytrip in a boat that takes you to multiple islands, travels along the bay and even stops in certain locations for kayaking, swimming and exploring.
If more time is available, I would recommend doing a multi-day cruise, since it navigates farther from the coast and travels deep into the bay to explore less frequented islands and locations.
