# Cambodia
Cambodia is full of history and incredibles temples to explore. The country itself is bit more poor than its neighbours, however, it has so much to offer. 

## Siem Reap
### Attactions
- Angkor; Angkor Wat is the primary attraction in Siem Reap. However, the Angkor region is full of temples and ruins that are definitely a must see. You can get a 1day, 3day or 7day pass for this region and all the temples. I got the 2day pass, and they were busy days but got enough time to explore all of them under the crazy cambodian heat. If you need to take your time, consider the 7day ticket. The ruins are massive, there is definitely enough for 7 days if you take your time.

- Pub Street; after walking through the majestic ruins and temples, you always need a beer. The Pub street is the perfect location. There are lots of bars and restaurants in this area. Some clubs are even open sometime and you see a lot of people walking around. Great place to explore at night. Some of the restaurants here offer Cambodian BBQ which I would recommend.

## Pnhom Penh
### Attractions
- Mekong River Sunset Cruise; it was a great discovery in my 2 day stay in Pnhom Penh. You get to cruise along the Mekong River at sunset. The view you will get at this time of day is priceless. The cruise itself was very relaxing and chill, a perfect combination with the view.
