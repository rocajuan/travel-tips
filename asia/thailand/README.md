# Thailand

Very busy and popular count. Full with tourism and attractions. It is a chaotic but beautiful environment filled with super friendly people, amazing food and fun all around. From street markets, temples, parks, malls, santuaries, floating markets to airplane cementeries, treks and incredible scenery; anyone can find something exciting to do in this beautiful country.

## General information about Thailand

- The details listed in (https://github.com/rocajuan/travel-tips/tree/master/asia), [Asia] are very relevant and important to keep in mind.
- The country is very safe, traffic is crazy and they drive on the other side of the street so be careful while crossing the street or walking.
- Food is super cheap and extremely tasty. You can find pad thai's at markets for $2 and other dishes that are equally tasty. There are lots of restaurants that vary in price so there is something for everyone.
- I had some issues with ATMs there, but if you face some problems withdrawing money, just try a different 'color' ATM. These ATMs are afiliated to different organizations, only some of them work with international cards. Do not freak out like I did.

## Bangkok
Bangkok is definitely a chaotic beauty. Traffic, lots of people and tourists everywhere, so many fun places to visit and always the classic tuktuk ride to jump on.

### Tours/Excursions
### Attractions
- Soi Cowboy, Bangkok's red light district.
- Khaosan Road, the backpacker's heaven; full of shops, tattoo shops, hostels, bars and clubs. This area changes drastically from day to night. Definitely worth checking during both times.
- Airplace Cementery, part of a walking tour and a hidden attraction.
- Chatuchak Market, one of the biggest markets in Bangkok. You can find everything and anything in this market. Bring water and confortable shoes, you'll walk a lot!
- Floating Market; there are several in Bangkok, I went to one in the north that you can get by car. Some other markets you can only get by boat. You can buy local food and treats. The market also provides options boat rides that are very fun.
- Grand Palance and other temples


## Chiang Mai
This city was extremely beautiful and full of adventure-like tours. My personal fovourite type of excursions. The old town is full of history and places to visit. It has great restaurants and plenty of bars. Massage parlour on every corner with great service for a reasonable price. Getting a Thai Massage(a real massage, not what you are thinking) in one of these places is definitely worth it.

## Phuket
This is one of the craziest cities I visited. The most popular for sure and full of tourists. The scenary in the islands and beached is trully unforgettable. The weather is amazing and it is a pretty safe area, nothing to worry about. Plenty of local restaurants with GREAT prices and really tasty food. Patong beach is the place to be if you want to party or bar-hop. It is a hub for the tourists and there is always something going on, day or night.

- Crabby Island

Notes:
- The islands are amazing, all tours include lunch in the boat, some cave tours and beach time. Defeinitely radvice doing at least one island.
