# Laos
In my trip to Asia, Laos was the biggest surprise and my favourite place for relaxing. It is definitely a country I would go back to and even live for a couple of months. The vibe is so nice, relaxing but at the same time adventurous.
The scenary in this country is amazing; with jungle like places as well as mountains. All my time was spent in Luang Prabang which was trully unforgettable. The town, bars, the nature, Mekong River and the night market are just a couple of things that you must see in Luang Prabang.

## Luang Prabang
### Atractions
- Kuang Si Falls; you can do it as a day trip or simply rent scooters and make your way there. If you have experience riding a scooper and would like to take your time in this adventure, I would recommed renting a scooter. The scenery on the way to the falls is breathtaking. The asian mountains, rice fields and nature around the road is amazing. It is extremely easy to get from Luang Prabang to the falls, its a single road with good signs, you can't miss it.
- Night Market; it starts at 6pm almost everyday and you can find souvenirs, food, clothing and weird alchohl bottles with animals inside(yeah, I know!). The night market is one of the cleanest I have seen ever and its trully worth exploring. Food is super cheap here as well, my first night here I tried a spicy pork soup for 15,000 Kip ($2.30 CAD!), I haven't found another soup as tasty as this one.
  Beware of the "all you can eat" buffet in this market, it looks amazing but it has a catch. You have to pay for every protein or meat you pick, the 'all-you-can-eat part only applies to the sides, vegetables and rice displayed. Of course, they don't tell you that until you are deep in the buffet. I learned the hard way.
- Scenery outside the city; again, exploring outside the city will result in awesome pictures and even better memories.
- Mekong River Cruise; it was a extensive tour in the Mekong river at around sunset. I was only two of us in the traditional long boat. The trip lasted almost 2 hours and it was definitely worth it. Incredible view.

## Vang Vien
- Highly recommended, its a river town noth of Luang Prabang, around a 4hr drive. Its a river town with lots of tours, treks and other things to do. Definitely worth staying at least 3 days considering the amount of time spent travelling to this location.
