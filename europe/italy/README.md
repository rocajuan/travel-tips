## Florence

One of my favorite cities in Italy. It's a calm and beautiful city with so much to see. Home of Michaelangelo's David and Il Duomo, this city is full of surprises and fun things to do.

Part of the book INFERNO, by Dan Brown takes place in this city, so following the same route the characters followed in the book and visiting the same places can give the book and the city another very entertaining aspect.
