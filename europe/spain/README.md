# Spain

Beautiful cities, great food and amazing weather are just a few things you will experience daily in Spain. The amount of history in every city, big or small, is incredible. It is a country with very rich culture and with a wide range of traditions and customs.

The country is divided in diffenrent regions, each of them with a lot of culture and very different from each other. You will encounter drastic changes in architecture, food taste and even accents as you travel around Spain.

Spain to me represents a extraordinary fusion of culture, traditions and history from several civilizations including the Spanish, Arab, Turkish, etc

For a short trip, [Barcelona](https://github.com/rocajuan/travel-tips/tree/master/europe/spain#barcelona), [Madrid](https://github.com/rocajuan/travel-tips/tree/master/europe/spain#madrid), [Córdoba](https://github.com/rocajuan/travel-tips/tree/master/europe/spain#cordona) & [Málaga](https://github.com/rocajuan/travel-tips/tree/master/europe/spain#malaga) are a great start, which will get you exposed to the rich culture and history of this country. If more time is available, Sevilla, Valencia, Málaga & Alicante are other great choices. Any city in general are very entertaining and in my opinion, worth it.

## General information about Spain
- The country is safe, no need to worry too much about safety or walking at night. People are friendly and the city is safe.
- Familiarize yourself with your route, as in, from airport to airbnb or hostel. Download an offline map on Google Maps, if you can't find WiFi, this is a live saviour.
- In certain places, restaurants & shops close during the afternoon for the "siesta" (nap).
- Spanish restaurants sometimes have this promotion, called "menú", which is a complete meal for a single price. By complete meal, I mean salad/appetizer, main dish, dessert/coffee. Amazing deal, great food and cheap. You can find places that offer this for like 12 euros or sometimes less. Note: The appetizers sometimes are full-size meals as well, for instance, stew(appetizer) + pasta(main dish). Pretty crazy, its awesome.
- Go to a Tapas bar and try as many things as you can. Food and drinnks are amazing.
- Ham is huge in Spain, if you don't have any dietary restrictions, try it.
- Try "Tinto de Verano", its a Spainsh drink that is very popular during the summer. Its light but delicious and super refreshing. Its made with wine and club soda and some ice.

## Alicante
This is mainly a beach town. If you enjoy spending the day in the ocean or sunbathing, this is a great city for you. There are many beaches all along the coast and lots of things to do in them. 

### Attraction
- City Center
- Feria en el malecón
Near the city center, you will find a peer with lots of boats and places t owalk around. You cannot swim in this waters but it is a very nice walk. In this same area, you will find a great number of restaurants facing the main street & peer. It is a very nice area to walk around during the day and at night since there are many restaurants, cafes and even bars to dgo to. During the summer, this area also hosts markets and fairs where you can find all sorts of things to shop.

Or you can also choose to stay at hostels or airbnbs close to the beach areas. This beach areas or "balneareos" are located a little farther from the city center in a more "suburd" area full of house and appartment buildings facing the ocean.

### Tours
- [FREE Walking Tour - Barcelona](http://www.neweuropetours.eu/barcelona)
You show up at the meeting spot(location should be on the website, ussually a subway stop) and ask for the english tour. They always carry a big RED umbrella, you will se it.
After the tour is done, you just tip the guide. They will explain it to you before the tour starts.
I would recommend doing this free walking tour as soon as you get there, it provides a nice foundation of history, attractions and tips
to start your trip right.

They also provide additional tours at other times for a price.
- Another recommended tour is the "Modernism Tour (Antoni Gaudi tour)". Its an architectural tour. Really worth it.
- Another cool/party tour is the "tapas Experience". Sample company provides it, its like the spanish version of a bar crawl. You eat tapas, drink wine/cider/beer then go to a club. WIN-WIN

### Attractions
- Sagrada Familia (Antoni Gaudi's church) [MUST SEE]
    You need to [buy tickets](http://www.sagradafamilia.org/en/tickets/) in advanced to enter. There are different types of tickets, but the audio/tour guide one is the best. The history behind the church is definitely worth it. You can also go up the cathedral towers.
- Park Güell (Antoni Gaudi lived there) [MUST SEE] Awesome park to walk around.
- La Rambla - its a shopping street
- Camp Nou (Go to a match, bro. It will probably be against a small team, but the vibe is worth it.)
- Barrio Judio (Its a neighbourhood)
- Parc de la Ciutadella (Another sick park)
- Gothic quarter neighoburhood
- Casas Modernistas (Modernism houses)

Walking around the city is also really great. The Free tour is a must. It gives you an idea of what you can see and you can ask the guide for advice
depending on how long you are staying. In the city you have so many nice restaurant and bars that there is no point on giving you names, just explore and you will find awesome ones.
